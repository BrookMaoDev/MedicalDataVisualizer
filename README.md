# Medical Data Visualizer

This project is a solution to the [Medical Data Visualizer challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer) from freeCodeCamp.

## Description

This project explores a medical dataset containing various health-related features such as cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The task involves analyzing key factors that may contribute to cardiovascular diseases.

## Example Findings

Two charts have been generated and saved in the root directory:

![catplot](catplot.png)  
This categorical plot demonstrates how people with cardiovascular diseases tend to have higher cholesterol and glucose levels, and are more likely to be overweight.

![heatmap](heatmap.png)  
This correlation plot shows how certain features are more correlated than others, such as sex and height, cholesterol and glucose, and blood pressure and cardiovascular problems.
